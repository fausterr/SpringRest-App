# SpringRest-App
Simplified simulation of a tool rental shop in the workplace. 
It allows you to assign items to a specific employee and create a loan card based on it. 
After the item is returned, the card becomes inactive and the item is returned to the database.
inspired by exercises and projects from javastart.pl
